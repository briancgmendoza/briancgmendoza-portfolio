# briancgmendoza-portfolio
My first portfolio

Live demo: https://briancgmendoza-portfolio.vercel.app/

Things to implement/fix:
1. Download resume - still looking for PDF Generator library to use and for download.
2. Implement terser/converting the image to .webp file
3. Add more personal projects - with state management (redux), class-based & functional.
4. Add modal when message me is clicked, instead of routing to email/form component?
5. Add react-router?
6. Adding classnames properly?
